## ðŸ’ª My Process

### ðŸ“‚ Built With

- **Semantic HTML5** markup
- **CSS Flexbox** for layout
- **Responsive design** best practices

### ðŸ“š What I Learned

I learned how to structure a semantic HTML document ðŸ§©, apply clean and consistent styles, and improve my responsive design workflow ðŸ“±.  
This challenge also helped me manage my time better and focus on building small, reusable UI components â€” in this case, an information card with an image (the QR code).

### ðŸ”„ Continued Development

I want to keep improving my **CSS styling techniques** and mastering **semantic HTML** with best practices in mind.  
My goal is to create **beautiful and accessible user interfaces** where users can navigate naturally and intuitively âœ¨.

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgments

Although this challenge is not particularly complex, itâ€™s a great exercise for reinforcing the **fundamentals of web development** â€” HTML and CSS.  
I highly recommend starting with challenges like this if youâ€™re new to web development.

Here are my tips:

- Go step by step, making sure you **understand each stage** before moving on.
- Pay close attention to the design details.
- Donâ€™t be afraid to use tools or references, but always make sure you **understand why** you are using a particular approach.
- Most importantly â€” **have fun while coding!** ðŸ˜„
